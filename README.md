# Webindex

An index of all web-related specifications, CSS properties, JavaScript interfaces, etc.

The data is heavily based on [W3C/browser-specs](https://github.com/w3c/browser-specs) and [W3C/webref](https://github.com/w3c/webref) with a lot of modifications and additions. The CSS stuff is 100% scraped by myself because the Webref data wasn't sufficient for me, and the WebIDL for the JavaScript stuff is a mixture of Webref's WebIDL database and IDL I scraped myself. Note that the hyperlink ids (hashes) for the specs of JavaScript interfaces are currently not very reliable as they have to be reverse-engineered and different specs handle them differently.
