I was working on my own browser spec collection for myself, using [w3c/groups](https://github.com/w3c/groups) as a starting point and manually adding lots of stuff, partially by looking at the interfaces in the window object in Chrome's JavaScript console &ndash; until I realized the existence of this repo and webref. This has the disadvantage of having wasted a lot of time, but also the advantage of being able to diff my spec list with yours and finding the differences.

Here are specs that I believe should be added to this repo:

## Specs that I think should be removed from browser-specs:
- Writing Promise-Using Specifications: https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/promises-guide
- W3C Patent Policy: https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/

## Various other things:
- There are currently two editor's drafts for SVG 2: SVG 2.1 at https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/ and SVG 2.2 at https://svgwg.org/svg-next/. Should the nightly url for the SVG 2 spec be changed to the svg-next version?
- CSS Animation Worklet's spec url changed from https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-animationworklet-1/ (without hyphen) to https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-animation-worklet-1/ (with hyphen).
- The link for CSS Style Attributes has the level number missing (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-style-attr/ instead of https://drafts.csswg.org/css-style-attr-1/). Not very important, but should be fixed for consistency.
- The [Web Cryptography Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/) doesn't seem to exist any more, and the [Web Cryptography API](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/) mentions the [Web Application Security Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webappsec/) as the group behind it.

Could some W3C person please either add the specs and modifications themselves or give me the OK and tell me which specs *not* to add so I can make a PR myself?
